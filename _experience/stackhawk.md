### **Front End Engineer**

Stackhawk is an AppSec startup building application security tooling to put AppSec back in the hands of developers through dynamic application scanning and CI/CD tools.

I collaborated on building the product web application from an early stage through beta, alpha, and production stages, iterating on functionality, unit testing, and design to provide an accessible, UX, and compliant application.

I collaborated with redesigning the product documentation website by doing the whole UI Front End architecture to support dark/light modes using a Jamstack approach to make it faster. Integrating third-party search with Algolia

I was in charge of the migration of the marketing website (www) from the Wordpress platform into a Headless CMS( GatsbyJS + Contentful) approach, with this redesign the site improved the website speed metrics, Web Vitals and provided a better UX to the customer and huge impact in the SEO.

Helped to coach and led a team of high-performing front-end engineers.

Helped to implement and lead the implementation of Unit Testing for the product.
