Today I got assigned a ticket and it consisted in fix a vulnerability that github was complaining about, it was located in package-lock.json saying that this file has some vulnerabilities, I removed the file and tried to run `npm install` command alone which didn't work, so I had to find another solution, not always you have to invent the wheel but instead know where you can find the information.
This was the message:

```
A dependency defined in package-lock.json has known security vulnerabilities and should be updated. 
```

So I found this solution I would like to share with anyone having this issue: 

Run this commands in order

1. `npm install <dep>`
2. `npm uninstall <dep>`
3. `npm update`
4. `npm install`
5. Commit `package-lock.json` and push to proper branch with the changes we just did by running the previous commands
6. Enjoy

That's it for me it worked like a charm, check it and let me know what you think !! :)
Thanks for reading this post if you have questions feel free to let me know, the best
