I had the privilege of leading a full migration project for one of the most prestigious Law Firms in Costa Rica, where we migrated an outdated PC application (Windows Application) to a more modern and efficient Single Web Application. As the Full Stack Developer in charge of the project, I was responsible for the architecture, planning, requirements gathering, implementation, DevOps, deployment, and continuous integration of the Web Application.

To achieve this goal, we utilized the MEAN stack, specifically MEAN.JS (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node). This allowed us to create a user-friendly and efficient financial application that could manage the Law Firm's cash flow, including deposits, checks, and financial transactions.

Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with the Law Firm's team to ensure that their requirements were met and exceeded. I also worked diligently to ensure that the application was fully integrated into their existing systems and that it could be easily managed and maintained going forward.

The stack of technologies used for this project included MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node, which provided a robust and reliable platform for the Web Application. Overall, this was an exciting and challenging project that I'm proud to have been a part of, and it showcased my expertise in Full Stack Development and the MEAN stack specificall
