I'm proud to have been the driving force behind a comprehensive software development project that involved creating a native mobile application for iOS/Android using Nativescript, as well as a single web application Back Office System to manage both the web and mobile applications. This was a challenging but exciting project that I undertook with passion and skill.

To make this project a success, I leveraged my expertise in a variety of cutting-edge technologies, including Nativescript, Angular 4, GraphQL, Express, and Node.js. I created a set of powerful backend services using GraphQL to support both the application and back office web app.

The main objective of this project was to build an internal database of all employees and track labor hours, along with geolocation, for internal use. This required careful planning and execution, as well as a deep understanding of the needs and expectations of the company. With my keen attention to detail and ability to think creatively, I was able to deliver a user-friendly system that met all the company's requirements.

Overall, this project was a tremendous success, and I'm proud of the hard work and dedication that went into creating it.
