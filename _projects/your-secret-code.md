As a Full Stack Developer Consultant for Your Secret Code, I led the successful migration of their self-served Node instance to a Serverless Architecture using Serverless Application Framework, improving performance and reducing operational costs. Additionally, I migrated their Mongo Database to AWS DynamoDB and refactored the codebase to improve readability and maintainability.

One of my key accomplishments was implementing ES6 in the website's core functions, which streamlined the book creation and generation process based on user input. This allowed for a more efficient and personalized user experience.

The stack of technologies utilized for this project included Serverless Application Framework, Node JS, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda Functions (node), AWS, and MongoDB. Overall, my contributions helped to enhance the website's functionality and improve the overall user experience.
